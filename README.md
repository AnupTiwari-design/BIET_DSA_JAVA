# Singly Linked List in Java

This repository contains a Java implementation of a **Singly Linked List** with basic operations commonly used in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## 📌 Features

- Insert at the beginning
- Insert at the end
- Insert at a specific position
- Delete from the beginning
- Delete from the end
- Delete from a specific position
- Reverse the linked list
- Count number of nodes
- Display the list

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

- Each node contains:
  - An integer `data`
  - A reference to the next node (`next`)
- All operations are implemented in a class called `Linkedlist`

## 📚 Topics Covered (DSA)

- Linked List basics
- Pointer manipulation
- Iterative traversal
- Edge case handling
- Reversal of a list
